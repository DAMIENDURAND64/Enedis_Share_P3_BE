## Concept

This project is our 3rd and last project in the WCS training, in collaboration with Enedis.
It's an API managing our data for our concepted platform of internal social network "Enedis Share".
The purpose is to share posts with title, text, image, and be able to comment.
These posts are protected by classing by spaces and categories (sub-spaces) with restricted members.
